# RTerm

![example.png](https://github.com/Rainfxxk/rterm/blob/main/img/example.png?raw=true)

A expriment project to learn the machanism under terminal which I use frequently in my study and work. I hope I can make it better enough for my daily use step by step. This is my little goal.

## Build

I just write this in Linux and never test it in other platform.

In Linux, make you have the SDL2 and SDL2_TTF development evironment, then run command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Rainfxxk/rterm.git
$ make
```

## TODO

- 256 and true color support
- ansi escape sequence for cursor control and other use
